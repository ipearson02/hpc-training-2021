### Note:  Reporting your work:
We will track your work using automated scripts, so you need to name the directories as described below:

1. Create a directory under your Comet home account, and call it "hpct21" (for HPC Training)
2. Create a subdirectory called week1. If you want to add more information to the name, you can
use the convention `week1_<your-description>`, e.g. `week1_<introduction>` .
* This should result in a directory called 
*	/home/$USER/hpct21/week1_<your-description>
